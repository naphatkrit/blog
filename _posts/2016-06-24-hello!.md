Welcome to my very first blog!

For the most part, this is a tech blog. I will be writing tutorials that I personally want to use later and that I hope will find useful. Why am I writing tutorials when there are easily dozens on the Internet only a Google search away? Well, I think that is true only to an extent. A lot of the times, I find that there is no one good tutorial for the specific thing I want to do, and I end up spending like 15 minutes going through a few different tutorials and picking up bits and pieces from each. If I can save a reader that 15 minutes, then even if I have just 10 readers, **that is 150 minutes saved** - probably more than the time I spent writing the tutorial to begin with.

Anyways, thanks for stopping by! Be sure to check back - I promise exciting and useful stuffs soon!
